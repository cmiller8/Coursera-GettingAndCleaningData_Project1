##Prepared by Clayton Miller

In this project, we have a file that was created from data from the following link: (below is copied and pasted form the assignment!)

Here are the data for the project:

Provided in the document is a run_analysis.R script that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set - this dataset is saved as a file called `total_data.csv`
4. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject - this file is called `total_csv_average.csv`

An updated Code Book is provided also
